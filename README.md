## Note

- Normally important information such as `.env` should not be added to GitHub projects, but I added it so that the application can be run by everyone.

## Getting Started

First, users must create an account in the system. Then, admins must approve these accounts. Only when this approval is completed and a Digital Key is created for the user, users can start using the system. This logic is made to protect the system from unnecessary use.

    ```bash
